## s combinators

a collection of ranges, to do 90% of the cases that I believe are hard to do with the std but should be easy

the core idea being, effecting the stucture of the range without mutating the main underlining data; sorting based on a result of a function, spilting a string by 80 char chunks and endline etc.

see examples.d for examples, copy paste scombinators.d into your project

#### todo
1. write sfilter
2. write sgroupby
3. improve s_spliter
